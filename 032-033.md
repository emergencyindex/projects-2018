or also i’m like, nah, imma see old             1. (a) list (for)
death can be comfortable             all (of) the time; a manual;
just gotta wear it right           2. find a dumpster; find food;
(i know, right?)                                     find yrself;
you know what they say about people who talk to catz?          3.
(i hope it’s not true.)                           zip tiez, like,
anyhow:             the really big zip tiez, probably need like 4
homesexualz & vicodin              to 6 & some thick plastic bagz

stainz                           (don’t tell anyone yr exit plan)
your necessary             wtf does a good note do, for me anyway
blood                 how fast is too hard; how slow is too soft;
blood stainz                        but, like, word play: who r u
my blood            what to do here, or there, or whenever u like
sit,   on making movement: on making sound: on making discussion:
stand,                               on collaboration or whatever 
sit,   make a form that people like ohyeah, make what people like
stand                           on keeping to yrself: hmm u sure? 
                   on relative structure: watch out for recursion
                                    and again, on what to do: «…»
