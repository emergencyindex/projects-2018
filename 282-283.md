Cynthia Post Hunt

“Dare to Bare / D.I.Y.” explores presence through notions of strength, expectation, and viewability while rejecting forms of entertainment, theatricality, and generosity.

The gesture considers the physicality of a bare wall and the physicality of my body. It is a survey of impulse through movement or lack of movement.

For three hours, I demanded and claimed my own space in a vacant commercial property.

6pm: I entered the space and put on a red suit.

Examples of initial [premeditated] movements:

Examples of eventual [impulse] movements:

9pm: I took off the red suit and exited the space.
