During “IN FLUX” Cayla Skillin-Brauchle and Chloe A. Lawton traded participants the tags from their clothing for custom made tags with Fluxus scores that suggested alternative ways to think about or use their clothing in future. The following Fluxus scores were written for this event:

STRETCH THIS GARMENT UNTIL IT TAKES UP ALL THE SPACES YOU NEED. IF IT CAN’T HOLD ALL OF YOU, FIND A LARGER GARMENT.

TREAT THIS GARMENT AS A BOAT, AN UMBRELLA, A MOP, A WIG, A TABLE CLOTH, A BASKET, A PILLOW, A MAP, A FLAG, A FRIEND. EFFECTIVENESS MAY VARY.

FEEL YOUR CLOTHING AGAINST YOUR SKIN, FEEL YOUR SKIN AGAINST YOUR BONES. WRAP YOUR GARMENT WHERE YOU FEEL WORN AND THREADBARE. TRY TO MEND FLESH WITH CLOTH.
