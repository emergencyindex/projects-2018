I got the idea for this performance from my poem “Monsters.”

I put black lipstick on my lips and shout “this is white.” I approach members of the audience, apply white lipstick to their lips, and drop black water into their mouths. I come back to my first seat, shouting “this is black.” I slice apples, throw them around me, and curl up. Audience members who have black water in their mouths come and drop black water on my body. The audience leaves and I slowly start to stand up and tear up my clothes. One, two, three, layers of white dresses are ripped out, and the last black dress comes into view.

_Monsters_

_You said i make monster in my mind_

_And it will be hurt you and me_

_I didn’t know what you were talking about at the time_

_However, monster was came to us_

_Bit you and me_

_And tore you and me to pieces_

_Now i know what you were talking about at the time_

_But_

_Was it really my monster or. . ._
