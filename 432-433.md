My practice is defined by the simplest of gestures that I repeat over hours. My movements, as they keep recurring, become ceremonies that I will often “end” by covering myself in natural or man-made materials. These form a protective layer, but many times the coating itself is too frail to stay put or so sturdy that it may cause harm. Through this repetitive ritual-like practice, I create a connection between the material and the body, opening possibilities for a different level of communication that might occur between the artist-object and audience.

“Reminiscences” is a performance that starts a conversation between the artist-object-audience, through explorations of stories, or what is left of them, after an object is left or forgotten. The object becomes a medium in the non-verbal communication with the audience, and its story is used as a catalyst to connect, bridging the limitations of language.

During my stay in Rio, I collected various objects on the streets of the city. This selection of objects, which appears random at first glance, is used to build a story through the performance. Each object has a story and is chosen to form a connection with the audience. In the performance, I alter the objects using pink glitter, which serves as a metaphor for the popular culture. I tie the objects to my tongue using copper wire, and then invite audience members to choose an object, cut the wire, and take it. This interaction creates a non verbal communication between artist and audience.
