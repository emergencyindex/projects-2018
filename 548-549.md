Natalie describes the horizon as “a place of perceptual exchange . . . a width of a line . . . a wilderness. . . Its immeasurability, the largeness of its perspective and sensuality, have been things non-Indigenous people have felt the need and fear to try and contain with a boundary, a line marking up and down, light and day, eventually all meaning good or bad.” We wanted to bring our distinct identities as poets, performance artists, and Indigenous women—Anishinaabek (Ontario, Canada) and Mojave (Arizona, US) respectively—together. We posed the horizon as impossibility and asked whether a thing which is impossible can be possible.

Our 40 minute interdisciplinary performance was a work-in-progress matching intuitive language and voice with movement that started with our hands as sky and water. Diaz’s writing focuses on social justice issues and her Mojave and Latina heritage. Hupfield’s hand-sewn industrial felt creations are multidimensional; further activated in live performance and video, they function as radical forms of collaboration, craft, and Indigenous futurity. For this performance Maria activated her Backwards Double Spiral Jingle Boots and a set of custom cut Fluorescent wooden boards. Three professionals were solicited as note takers throughout the process including a Nicole Wallace Poet, IV Castellanos Performance Artist, and Abou Farman Anthropologist. We requested the audience meet us in the horizon.
