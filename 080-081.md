In this work, I suspend an American flag-printed t-shirt on a rope, and tether the other end to my body. As I move around the space, the t-shirt is dunked into a bucket of water on the floor in a “washing” gesture. I interact with one hundred pounds of clay on the ground, assuming various safety drill positions, kneading the clay with my knees and elbows, and shaping it to the negative space displaced by my cowering body. This is performed to the song “Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning),” by Alan Jackson, a song that won Jackson the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Country Song. This work is intended to survey the transformation of national identity post-9/11, the relationship between scale and tragedy (and terror and spectacle), and their effects on the individual. This work is also heavily impacted by the effects of 9/11 on my own understanding of my identity as an American. As a white-passing person of South Asian descent, my whiteness was interrogated post September 11, 2001. This event implicated and politicized myself and my family’s identities as Americans. This performance is a vigilant attempt to combat the disassociation that often attends hybrid identities and to reclaim personal illegibility as a meaningful demonstration of resistance.
