Supersede Me

Daria Blum

“Supersede Me” is a live performance which incorporates music and video, structured around a series of original songs I wrote for my various personas and alter egos. In this staged piece, partly choreographed and partly improvised, I shift from one character to the next, changing costumes, personalities, and stage lighting accordingly. Subverting the genres of dance, musical, and theatre, I allow my personas to stumble through the failures and contradictions of daily life. In a narrative which is revealed both on a video screen and in the flesh, I highlight their struggles to reconcile competing facets of personality. As the performance unfolds, the footage on screen alternates between visuals functioning as a backdrop, as a light source, or displaying digital renditions of my characters who communicate directly with their live counterparts. Though consciously ironic, “Supersede Me” considers the masochism of performance, exploring how performance operates in day-to-day interactions and, operating on the margin of public and private space, consolidates and contrasts dynamics such as audience and performer, humour and tragedy, truth and fabrication.
