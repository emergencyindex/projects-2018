This performance was a layered reading responding to a language-based score, and the result of interventions sourced from _The Waves_, by Virginia Woolf. The score locates wave patterns through a process of extruding prepositions and conjunctions from Woolf’s text, where gaps surface to amplify an undercurrent of language, buoyant and slippery on the page. “Liquidity is a principle of language; language must be filled with water,” Gaston Bachelard writes in _Water and Dreams_.

Using a loop pedal, microphone, and amplifier, the reading allows words to overlap and become spatial, enveloping the audience in sound. While prepositions help us understand our relative and spatial location, these convergences of cadence and layered speech through chance operations evoke a sense of placelessness, a collective displacement, a sonic embodiment of being lost at sea.
