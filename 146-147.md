This is a solo performance and meditation on remembering and forgetting, an exploration of the inner rhythm of embodying memories through the recuperation of buried silence and the fetus of remembering. Audience members are invited to enter into the performance through the elements of multi-media, soundscapes, voice-over, and slowness. On stage, a performer moves very slowly and these movements are interwoven with images of her past through photographs projected onto a screen which she stands behind. There is a voice-over of her memories and thoughts with a haunting soundscape that adds another layer of her inner journey of remembering.
