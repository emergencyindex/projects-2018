“Dis-rupted” was a durational performance that focused on the materiality of bread dough and women’s bodies in a designated space. “Dis-rupted” was the largest project I had attempted with bread dough to date, inviting twelve female identifying women to create 900 lbs of dough in a public performance setting held on December 4th, 2018. The (anti)climax of the event saw the performers lay in the dough as it rose around them, consuming their bodies for a period of over an hour. This work is a continuation of my investigations into the materiality of bread dough and my focus on the notion of the intimate body, especially the female body.
