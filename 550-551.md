In this work, I play Shakespeare’s classic literature, the tragedy of Hamlet, on a table top with found toys. I try to find a metaphorical relationship between the characters and the found objects. I enhance the audience’s feelings through visual connection. I hide myself behind the objects and jump out of the stage. I discuss the role of the body in performance. I hope to develop the possibility of the tabletop theater by the way of changing my stance in different roles and connecting with the objects.
