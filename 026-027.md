Our Heart Beats

Neill Prewitt

On the winter solstice, I led the participatory performance “Our Heart Beats.” It was a warming and playful affirmation of community and generativity, and signalled a turn towards participatory play in my practice. I prepared for the performance by collecting everyday handheld objects, including a shovel and a slinky. I welcomed the audience. Building slowly, I improvised an a cappella sound piece in which I recorded, looped, and layered short rhythmic and melodic phrases. Every time I recorded and looped an audio phrase, I revealed a prop, demonstrated how it could be moved in time to the audio phrase, presented it to the crowd, and gave it to whomever didn’t look away from me. I continually kept eye contact with the participants, responding with the vocal phrases I recorded, giving eager people props, and playfully encouraging reticent people to participate. We performed together, both the music and the movements increasing in complexity as time progressed.
