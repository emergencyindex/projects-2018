Scenes from the House

Anna Berndtson

For 48 hours I inhabit the gallery space exploring my own limits as well as those of the public. “Scenes from the House” is a kind of live collage performance that uses scenes from Bergman’s films in combination with my own previous performance work and puts them into a new context. I also cite Marina Abramovic´’s performance “The House with the Ocean View” (which simultaneously is being re-performed at the retrospective exhibition at the Bundeskunsthalle, Bonn). I focus on my own body and my perception of space, as well as my surroundings, memory, and past. I question what is still genuine in today’s digital and fast-moving society. I create images in the minds of the public, using clear focused tasks that I perform for hours. I reach a lasting intensity and a deceleration that requires patience and the will of the public to engage.

The framework for the performance is a new exhibition “Nude With . . . Bergman” with performative photographs for which I have mounted myself in filmstills from Ingmar Bergman. The works examine the art term “Nude with,” explore the female nude, and play with female representation in the films of Ingmar Bergman, who would have turned 100 in 2018. With my digital collages I re-illuminate the classic films, combining past and present, and creating still life images from moving images.
