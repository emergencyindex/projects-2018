As Cuquita the Cuban Doll (my alter-ego), I sit immobile in an open suitcase, the one with which I traveled from Havana to Miami in 2011. It displays all the personal belongings that accompanied me in my travel: family letters, my one-way Havana to Miami plane ticket, artworks from my lover, photographs, costumes from performances, a _Granma_ newspaper with a statement of what the Cuban Revolution embodies. “90 miles” reflects on my experience as a recent immigrant exploring universal displacement and trauma.
