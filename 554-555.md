For almost the entirety of the two months I did not see the sun when I was in Seydisfjordur, Iceland. The mountains were high and the sun remained low. This was performed on the Winter Solstice and started my ongoing project of various exercises performed by myself, documented by a camera.

I walked in circles on the shortest day of the year for as long as the sun was up at 30 minute intervals. I walked so my feet made impressions, so a path was clear and simple. I walked so I worked through the ice, the snow, the grass, the dirt. I walked so I was burying myself. Gravity is a force that is constantly working against me, trying to drive my feet deeper into the earth and bury me where I stand. And so I work with my sadness. In this situation, gravity was working with meâ€”we shared a common goal on the longest night of the year.
