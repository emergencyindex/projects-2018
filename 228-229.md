This is a performative score involving collaboration and communication amongst strangers. There are red satin gloves hanging from the ceiling. Each person puts on a pair of gloves. Each person thinks of a pose that represents survival to themselves; no two poses can be the same. Each person teaches their pose to the rest of the group. Standing in a line, the group performs each pose in sequence as a group. Gloves are removed, and five new people can repeat the process.

With this interactive installation, I am investigating how gestures can convey meaning that language cannot. With a multidimensional idea like survival, working beyond the bounds of language is a way to discover both common ground and new information. I’m also very interested in the role of mimicry in addressing audiences. What does it mean to embody someone else’s gesture or pose? I’m curious about how interaction with this score can provide an opportunity for conversations that might not otherwise take place, while also using gestures and the body to liberate, amplify, or extend communication and speech.
