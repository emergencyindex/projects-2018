the mobius artists group

“Dadamobile” was a month-long series of guerrilla performances which took place in and around Boston, MA. For the second week of performance, members of the Mobius Artists Group attempted DADA ACTIONS created by the Mobius Artists Group and international, national, and local artists. At least one dada action resulted from a sense of frustration at not being “heard” by onlookers. The group also performed two scores/dada actions submitted by an artist in Turkey. One of the scores entitled “VIP” resulted in the group being forced to leave the farmers market where it was being performed. All performances were documented on the accompanying blog “dadabloge” modelled on Tristan Tzara’s dadaglobe. dadabloge also received hundreds of submissions from the national and international community which were subsquently published. One of the questions we were collectively attempting to answer was: is dada still relevant today? And if so, how do we incite people into action? I would say we had mixed results.
