ART=LIFE(gamble)

Art is equated with life. Since many consider life to be a gamble, I also equated art with gambling.

If you want to gamble with me, I put up part of my body and €10.

If you want to gamble and experience the associated happiness, you need to put up ten times more money: €100.

Then you need to prick between my fingers on my hand with a knife three times within fifteen seconds. If you do not cut me, you take my €10.

If you do not succeed in time, and cut me, I take your €100.
