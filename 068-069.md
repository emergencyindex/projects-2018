I need to be closer to you (DST IV)

Emily DiCarlo

Through the lens of Romantic Conceptualism, “I Need To Be Closer to You (DST IV)” exhibits how shifting temporal frameworks can put felt strain on long-distance relationships. The fluctuating temporal orientation of two lovers comes to the forefront and centers on the physical moment when spring Daylight Saving Time regulations go into effect and clocks turn ahead to lose an hour. In relation to the steady ticking of unphased Saskatchewan, a felt temporal distance dilates between the two individuals from a one-hour to a two-hour difference. This kink in cadence produces an oscillating yet consistent format of time variation every year: for six months of the year during DST, the individuals are two hours apart, and for the remaining six months, they are only one hour apart. Through the process of documenting, dissecting, manipulating, and finally re-constructing the performed-for-video footage, the final work conceptually remedies a creative loophole by performing a simulation of closeness to reclaim the lost time and to resist manufactured temporal restrictions.
