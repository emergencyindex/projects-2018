“(Up)rooted” is a personal search for learning radical self-love as an immigrant of color, when most (if not all) forms of socialization in my upbringing were conditioning me to comply to white heteronormative standards.

Starting as a dance installation and later explored through monologues, this piece focuses on the struggle to find self-love in a society that “democratically” disenfranchises immigrant, queer and POC bodies through the enforcement of contradictory and outdated immigration policies. (Up)rooted is my courageous effort to reclaim my immigrant narrative and find my roots in a place where I’m profoundly uprooted.
