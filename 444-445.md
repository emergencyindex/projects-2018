“But Wait . . . There’s More! (Endless Value)” is a performance about the production of desire and value through mediated images. The performance lasted four hours. For this performance, which is based on the history of infomercials, I used the language and gestures used in televised sales pitches, while removing references to specific products. This amalgamation of advertising language was repeated with slight changes throughout the duration, just as a sales pitch would be.

In this work, I am interested in giving viewers a space to really look at the tools capitalism uses to manipulate outside their typical context. In this case, with the object of a sales presentation missing, the viewer can just focus on how a pitch affects them, how desire is produced, despite no object of desire. While these pitches are typically thought of as ridiculous, infomercials have been and continue to be financially successful. Despite the initial difficulty of inducing desire in an audience, by emulating the honed techniques showcased in infomercials, the performance was remarkably productive.
