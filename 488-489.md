A small group of demonstrators makes a peaceful and elegant walk worthy of the highest-born aristocrat. Dressed in suits and ties, badges, and anarcho-capitalist banners, they walk through the streets of San Pedro Garza García, the municipal district with the highest GDP in all of Latin America.

This situationist drift in favor of the capitalist system in hodgepodge with the libertarian ideology is a nod to the historic event headed by the politician and anarcho-capitalist economist Per Bylund, who organized the Walk for Capitalism in Stockholm during 2001 and 2002.

The performance “Walk for Capitalism” aims, under the format of simulation of this concrete historical event, to open an ironic space for criticism of the economic system in which we are immersed.
