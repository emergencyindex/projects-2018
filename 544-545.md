I gradually constructed a golem out of recycled clothing, fabric, and garbage. The construction occurred during First Friday openings and open gallery hours, and I invited audiences to write commands for the golem to fulfill once brought to life. The performance-installation culminated in a life-giving ritual. Animated by real kabbalistic magic, the golem (operated by puppeteers Rachel Brown and Mal Cherifi) fulfilled many of the audience’s wildest commands, including “Celebrate Witches,” “Eat Our Shame with Love,” and “Kill Capitalism.” Sadly the ritual was interrupted by our indignant Rabbi (Miryam Coppersmith), who decried our heathenish antics, fell in love with the golem, and unleashed an uncontrollable life-force in his own attempt to animate the creature. Instead, he animated a series of other objects and unleashed a horde of chaotic demi-golems. Nonetheless, we succeeded in demonstrating the existence of real magic and transmuting reality into absurdity, failure into creation, and a heap of garbage into a valiant dream-warrior golem.
