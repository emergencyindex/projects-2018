In October 2018, I lived and worked on an Icelandic sheep farm in Richmond, VT. Over the course of two weeks, I engaged in daily rituals of care with the sheep. Three sheep—Luna, Aurora, and Juniper—became the main participants in a ritual performance titled “Idolatry II.” Everyday I would call them over and massage them to remove burrs that had accumulated in their wool. At this point in the season, the sheep were nearly ready to be shorn, so their wool was several inches thick. It often took two sessions to untangle one burr. Over time, the sheep would come to me without being called, nudging my hands until they received a massage. After two weeks, I took all of the burrs collected from the bodies of Luna, Aurora, and Juniper to create a sculptural work in cast bronze. “Idolatry II” serves as a performative document of an interspecies ritual that resists slaughter and animism. The work is intended to explore the complexities of emotional care as a repeated corporeal act with larger intersectional concerns. This object represents a process of mutual care and kinship within a context whereby both human and nonhuman animals participate in the carceral conditions of domestication.
