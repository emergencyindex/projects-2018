From the perspective of a family’s generation, a person’s life will probably go through two stages of childhood, old age, and adolescence. The childhood value of human beings is constantly recalibrated because it is influenced by the society’s culture. Beginning with a baby’s state of understanding, the performance combined the conversations with the audience as a participant and sculpture, different cultural mythological texts and my physical interpretations. In the performance, I divided the piece into three periods of childhood history chronologically, and told the stories from fifteenth century to twentieth century that show how we change our perceptions toward children. In the sea of life, the audience re-explored and picked up the childhood stories in history.
