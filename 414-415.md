“Evening without Angels” was part of the “Rear Window” performance series that took place in the residential window of the Glasshouse building. The window served as a frame of the performance as well as the surface separating the audience and performer, lending a film-like experience of the event. “Evening without Angels” examines the intersection of domesticity and femininity in the context of psychological trauma. A solitary woman confined within a white room executes a sequence of meticulously crafted gestures veering between suspenseful stillness, sharp gestures, and emotional extremes. Through the fusion of movement with dramatic costume and light, a shifting tableaux of surreal imagery emerges—offering the spectator a glimpse into the private world of a woman struggling to prevail.
