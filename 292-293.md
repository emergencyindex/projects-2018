Sand to the Beach

G Douglas Barrett

“Sand to the Beach” asks musician(s) to realize the phrase, “Playing music by white cis men today is like bringing sand to the beach”—a comment that was either overheard or imagined while attending an influential new music festival—by performing a work of western art music on a beach while being covered from head to toe in sand. In the process, “Sand” attempts to describe the present state of art music and its pervasive underrepresentation of composers/musicians of color, women, and gender-nonconforming artists through a musical setting of a kind of found verbal graffito.
