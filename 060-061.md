TracE

Rui Sha

The senses of tenderness and sadness that do not reach an endpoint can be represented by the faint trace left behind. “Trace” is an object-based performance that expresses the intensely personal experience of sadness and explores the possibility of subjective sensibility. During the course of the performance, blue ink drips onto the canvas, leaving a trace. This represents the process of a person struggling under the enormous influence of sadness, and proposes a method of balancing uncontrollable emotion and the desire for a peaceful moment. The gesture of the performer turning her back to the audience suggests the privacy of the performer, which indicates that, although the performance itself is public, it remains a moment of personal experience. After the performance, only the canvas marked with blue traces of ink remains as evidence. The conflict revealed through the performance is one of obstinate emotion and the desire to achieve pure inner peace.
