Telephus

Yiannis Pappas

The words “Ο τρώσας και ιάσεται” (Greek ancient proverb, meaning: “Only he who inflicts the wound can cure it”) refers to a prophecy that was given by the oracle of Apollo to Telephus about how he should heal up his wound caused by Achilles.

In this durational performance lasting 175 hours, I wrap parts of my body in plaster, and in so doing suggest a devotion to self-awareness. I sculpturally produce a paradoxical quasi-embodiment of the civilized global body, thus positing a critique about personal and collective asphyxia.
