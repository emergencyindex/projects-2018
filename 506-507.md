Sculpture Social

Carl Cardinal

“Sculpture Social” (“Social Sculpture” in English) is an eleven minute performance inspired by toxic masculinity. The performance takes place distinctly at the center of a tablecloth. The intervention begins when I step into the room in white Calvin Klein underwear and kneel down near a pyramid of protein powder. That underwear has become the costume I wear for all my performances that deal with toxic masculinity. In a way, it is a wink to the image of the virile man that is used by this brand to sell products.

Once installed on the ground, I first isolate with a marker some muscles in my body by delineating them with dotted lines. Subsequently, I fill these spaces by adding the mixture of protein powder to create new shapes on my body and to accentuate those muscles. I then begin to play with these forms, deconstructing them and creating new ones similar to the feminine form. Thus, I distort the extreme imagery of the strong and virile man and reintegrate a part of femininity. I use protein powder, which is promoted by our society as a means of achieving male beauty standards in terms of fitness. My repeated actions demonstrate the pressure that some people can feel to conform to these standards, which in some cases becomes an obsession. Through building new forms and deconstructing the body, I play with perceptions of gender to show that these are only social constructions.
