My intention with this action is to highlight the beauty of culture and how, despite the difficulties, Armenian culture remains very strong. As a result, what remains of the flag is simply the real essence of culture, the sweetness of it. The flag belongs to politics and the real importance belongs to traditions and culture what people share and not what people struggle or fight for.

With this action I wanted to symbolically melt the borders away, leaving only the sweetness and the beauty of humanity. The first “Melting Borders” happened in Armenia and, by performing it, I wanted to highlight the essence and beauty of its culture.

The shirt is what remains of the action which I intend to repeat in other countries and it also represents a new flag which is “politics free,” the “Sweet Flag.”
