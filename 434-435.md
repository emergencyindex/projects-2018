The title is a pun on the expression “Presidential Race.” This performance is in response to the candidacy of religious politicians who, through their speeches, attack the state’s secularism. They use the Bible and the Constitution as instruments of shield and control.

The performer is tied to an iron bar that is attached to the ground, and rotates around the shaft itself. After a few minutes, the bar detaches from the fixed structure and the performer begins to move through space.
