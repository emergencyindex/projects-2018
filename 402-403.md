With the “body” theme in mind, I centered my performance around a custom-made nude bodysuit top with two ten-foot protrusions stemming from my chest that resembled heavy, sausage-like breasts. From Westbeth Gallery, I walked along the High Line, eastbound on 14th Street, through a farmers market, carrying the attached weight of my heavy suit with the help of Ikea bags. At Union Square, I untied the ends of the “breasts” and shook out all the fabricated internal soft sculpture objects: abstract noodle shapes, implants, donuts, chicken wings, a phone, five babies, and a life size man. After letting it loose, I put myself back together by re-stuffing and tying the ends up like sausage casings. With the weight of the appendages attached and strung over my shoulders, I walked the 1.5 miles back to the gallery, helped by friends and passersby along the way.
