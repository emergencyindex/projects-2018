OF OF MICE AND MEN

ALEX RANDRUP / SAMANTHA CLARK / BONITA JACKSON / EMILY AUCIELLO / SIENA ZOE ALLEN

“Corey and Vanessa Present an All-Female Educational Touring Production of _Of Mice and Men_” is a devised theater piece about power, pleasure, performance, and possession. It was originally developed December 2016–April 2017, in response to the presidential election, in an attempt to theatrically unearth some kind of ancient tool we could offer for our audiences to take with them out of the theater and back into the fight against the patriarchy.

This play is a low-brow divine comedy about two actors trying to fulfill their contracts and create some sort of safe space on a tour where everyone seems to be mysteriously disappearing one by one. Their efforts to carry on with the show by themselves are derailed when an ancient, invisible, possession-happy Goddess shows up in search for new vessels. Corey and Vanessa have to navigate strange blackouts, audience expectations, and their own self-doubts in order to take on the Goddess and save mankind.
