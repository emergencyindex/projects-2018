“Frustraciones” is a performance that makes reference to the anxiety that the social pressure of becoming a housewife produces on me. Being native to a hispanic country I grew up around comments and implicit expectations about becoming a wife and a mother. In this performance, I bit white stoneware pieces in their leather-hard stage at a dinner table setting. As I bit the carefully crafted flower vases, teapots, teacups, and bowls, I violently abuse the pieces leaving them unfunctional. After biting the ceramic pieces they are bisqued-fired and glazed, making the bitemarks, a spontaneous event, into a permanent documentation of the intimate relationship of the material and my own body.
