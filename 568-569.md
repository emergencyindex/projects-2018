Homesick

Michelle Magallon

“Homesick” is an exploration of my feelings towards my hometown—Panama City, Panama—when I am not there. When I was younger, my grandmother would make me hibiscus flower tea with lemon and honey when I was sick. Channeling this homemade remedy, I decided to “cure” my homesickness by eating hibiscus flower petals that I stuck all over my face. In the performance, I eat all the flowers from my face while coldly looking at a camera as if it were a scientific experiment. This performance is my ceremony to try and dial in my feelings of sadness that are so apparent that they can be read from the top of my skin, similar to the Spanish phrase _a flor de piel_ (which literally translates to “a flower of skin” but refers to something very visible).
