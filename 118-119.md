I put myself into a big transparent ball and walked around in the city. Thirty minutes later, the temperature inside the bubble started to rise. My breath generated warmth and made the bubble fog up. I wrote the word “hug” on the surface and it attracted many pedestrians to come and try to hug me. People spread their arms and all they could touch was the big bubble. However, I was reaching out from inside to them, just like they were reaching out to me.
