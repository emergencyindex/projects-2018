“Azriel” is a Butoh performance adventuring the interspiritual space between earth and astral planes, Jewish and Spiritualist faiths. “Azriel” is a personification of death, a guide, a caretaker. The role of the earthbound medium similarly bridges our material existence to the mysterious, unseen realm. Using the common language of craft, I honor my ancestors and offer healing.

This work of dance theater embodies and navigates sky space, collecting souls along the way. The light shifts from cool blues and white to soft pinks in coordination with the sound. The outfit is composed of handmade garments, including metal accessories, and found bird wings. The soundscape is composed by the artist using a synthesizer, field recordings, original poems, and prayers.
