In garb and costume (most basically, “Blue Face Jesus”), I took a slow teetering marshmallow wonder walk (“Smurf Walk”) down Broadway. I offered out cards (business cards), with turning score instructions CALM DOWN CHEER UP, that I had printed out the day before at a big box office supply store. There are a lot of divine and fantastic references regarding beings portrayed as blue, including smurfs. The nature of the Smurf Walk involves trying to maintain a sense of complete wonder at your surroundings. Everything is brand new, including your body. Things are undifferentiated, perhaps of different “energies” “colorful” “moving” “still.” You’ve never walked before, and you are so powerful, and you want to restrain your energies for fear of smashing all these new wonders, but you can barely contain or control your new body. Eye contact or not. No talking. Can not stop, can not retreat, slow as possible. Took about two hours. I took the Q from home and back.

Some of this performance continues indefinitely until this information is lost.
