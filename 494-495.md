Бабушка | BAb(oo)shka

Anna Lublina

This is an experimental iteration of “Бабушка | BAb(oo)shka” in which I was exploring the idea of “queer translation,” i.e. a translation that embraces the spaces of a language that cannot exist in a new language. The translation is by three (non-Russian) multicultural performers standing in as three different versions of my grandmother. Using in-ear devices, they listen to an audio transcript of my grandmother’s story and immediately attempt to re-perform her language. They speak Russian to the best of their abilities, which generally results in gibberish. Their interpretations create a meta-conversation about the remnants of miscommunication across generations regardless of nationality, exploring how a story changes depending on who is telling it, and when.
