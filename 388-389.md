“Melted Riot” is a duet featuring myself and Will Courtney engaged in a binary of solos. We wallow in transitional space and eventually collide to create one solo in which we become one surreal form. My solo, “Glitch,” is a meditation on incremental movement and demands I stay in a nonstop digital rhythm (a choreographed meditation on gender fluidity, butch and femme, stuck and loose). The solo I choreographed for Will demands his movement be as smooth and continuous as possible (he dances through the spectrum of victory and loss, grief and joy; a meditation inspired by medically transitioning and his FTM experience). We dance to music that played on the jukebox during the Stonewall Riots of 1969. What happens when seemingly opposed ways of moving collide and create a new being, sculpture, relationship? “Melted Riot” is a transgender ritual, a surreal protest song, a queer meditation, a psychedelic research project, a punk prayer. “Melted Riot” is dedicated to a vision I had of drag artist and cabaret singer Stormé DeLarverie throwing the (legend has it) first punch that incited the Stonewall Rebellion after she was the victim of police violence.
