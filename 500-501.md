“Wire Bath” is a fetishistic performance in which I enact my fantasy of being in a bath full of ethernet cords. I washed myself and the wires with a pink pouf, repeatedly untangling and retangling, and relaxing amidst the technology and bubbles. The cords entwine my body and peek out of the bubbly water like tentacles from the ocean. The storefront window steamed up from the hot water and was periodically wiped down to offer a clearer view as I bathed.

As more and more of our technologies are “wireless” and we continue to use the cloud as the dominant metaphor for understanding the internet, I reconnect with the physical cables used to transfer data. The tub becomes a miniature model of cyberspace and repositions the cloud underwater, where much of the physical infrastructure of the internet does in fact exist.
