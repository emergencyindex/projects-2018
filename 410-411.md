I create interactive public performance. In 2018, I was invited to create four public performances for Woerdz, a spoken-word festival in Lucerne, Switzerland. The first performance was in a public plaza where I asked the public to share important life moments. After my poetic interpretation of their important life moments the contributors would then receive poetry posted to their homes through the mail. I studied the movement of people using the public plaza prior to deciding where to locate my performance. In observation, the majority of the public engaged my work in proximity to a book sharing stand. They would become engaged by replacing a book or taking a book. I chose to locate my performance close to this. I initiated the public performance by sharing a selection of some of my previous people poems and invited people to share their important life moments. A queue quickly formed and by the end of the two-hour performance I had spoken to fourteen people who, over the next couple of months, would receive poems written by hand, in calligraphic style, in the mail. The receipt of the gift of poetry is an integral aspect of my practice.

As an artist, Iâ€™m preoccupied with the collapse of language and how we can readdress this situation through interactive performance. In the United States, we are living under a crisis of the spectacle where we are overloaded with images, information, and a constant barrage of news that can create a vacuous mindset. It is often exhausting and can leave us emotionally empty. My work seeks to add deeper meaning to our lives through the interpretation of experience into poetic thought.
