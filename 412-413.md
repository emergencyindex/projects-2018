This performance was done while at a one-month-long residency in Berlin at the Institut für Alles Mögliche. The piece was performed on the two year anniversary of the sudden death of my partner. The performance documents the struggles of carrying around the heavy and constant grief that comes with losing a loved one. During the performance I hold two large, heavy bricks that were found on the street in Wedding, Berlin. I was taken aback by the grief that surrounds Germany and was moved by the ways in which grief can be a palpable emotion. We have all experienced varying degrees of grief and sorrow. As societies and as people, how are we living with all of this weight and why do we often feel that we must bear it alone? During the performance, I have many rules that I do not disclose, but you can watch my body and facial expressions to experience with me how difficult this task is. Performance art is a way that I can use my body to convey these strong emotions that I have and connect with my audience to create some sort of release.
