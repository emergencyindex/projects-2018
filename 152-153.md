“Tales: Through Fire and Water” is a site-specific and participatory performance experience based on notions of community, healing, and collective rituals. Within the natural landscape of the Rosekill Estate, Coco Dolle designed a program inviting the audience to therapeutic performance practices with the members of Legacy Fatale, including initiative workshops with a hypnotherapist and a vocal coach. We hereby offered the public a way to experience their personal emotional landscape within the group—bringing a sense of community back together—while exploring issues of inclusiveness, self-awareness, and identity.

After the initiative workshops, the public was invited to gather for a marking ceremony with signature ornamentations from Legacy Fatale (black and white face make-up and a tied piece of white tiger fabric). A procession led by an intergenerational group of adults and children was taken to the lake of the estate to conduct the “fire and water ceremony” involving the four elements of water, air, fire, and earth. A ritual reminiscent of ancient folklorism, invoking notions of purification with nature in a triangular relationship of body, mind, and spirit.
