About 412 migrant deaths were recorded in 2017 due to crossing the US/Mexican border. Immigrant corpses are often found in pieces with skull and human guts separated from their bodies making it impossible to identify them. The dehumanizing tactics and rhetoric of war have transformed the border into a permanent zone of exception, where some of the most vulnerable people on earth face death and disappearance on a daily basis.

Violence does not grow organically in our deserts or at our borders. It has arrived there through policy. 2018 was the year of the Central American Caravan and the immigration laws recently changed by president Trump increased the deaths of children and innocent people at the borders.

This video performance consisted of finding and picking up about twenty pounds of raw animal guts, tripe, liver, and intestines from an empty plot of land. I searched for and collected the guts, putting them around my neck and shoulders as an act of solidarity to the effected immigrants, but also as a protest of the inhumane immigration laws in the US.
